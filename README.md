# Protest noise makers

Simple 3D printable noise makers. Use for fighting colonialism, fascism and unfair labor practices. 

Developed during the UCLA Graduate strike of 2022.

## 3D printable files

Ready to print .stl files are located in the [3DprintFiles](3DprintFiles) directory. 

There's two models: 
- [NoiseMakerSimple.stl](3DprintFiles/NoiseMakerSimple.stl) is a single chamber model. Easiest and quickest to print. 
- [NoiseMakerTriple.stl](3DprintFiles/NoiseMakerTriple.stl) is a triple chamber model. Much louder and creates a poly tonal sound. Uses much more material to print. 


## Assembly guide

#### Step 1 - Gather materials
To build a noise maker, you will need:
- a 3D printed noise maker body (using the single chamber model for this guide)
- some sandpaper (something like 150 grit works well)
- a pair of scissors
- a rubber band
- a nitrile glove (latex gloves, balloons, or plastic bags can also be used)

#### Step 2 - Remove supports from 3D printed body

#### Step 3 - Sand the upper end of the body, until there are no sharp irregularities

#### Step 4 -  Cut a square of material from the glove. It needs to be bigger than the diameter of the body. This will act as the vibrating membrane.

#### Step 5 - Stretch the membrane over the sanded end

#### Step 6 - Secure the membrane with the rubber band. Make sure it's tight and that there are no creases.
